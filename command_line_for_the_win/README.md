This is my command_line_for_the_win Project.


I took the following steps to complete the project.

. Take the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.
  Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

. Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. Y  ou will need the hostname, username, and password provided to you for the sandbox envi  ronment.

. Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.
  Use the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sand  box environment.

. Confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbo  x directory.

  Once the screenshots are transferred, you can proceed to push the screenshots to GitHu  b as mentioned in the initial requirements.

  Make sure to include the steps you followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your   projectâ€™s README.md file. This will help the reviewers understand how you performed th  e file transfer using SFTP.
