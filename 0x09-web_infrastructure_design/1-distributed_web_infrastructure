Load Balancer:
A load balancer was added to distribute incoming traffic across multiple application servers for load balancing and high availability. It ensures even distribution of requests and prevents overloading a single server


What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works?
The Webinfastructure was configured with a Round Robin algorithm. It routes requests to servers in a circular order, distributing the load equally.

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
The web infrastructure was configured in Active-Active setup. All application servers are active and handle requests simultaneously. Active-Active ensures efficient use of resources.

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works?
This was implemented for data redundancy, fault tolerance, and improved read performance. The primary server (master) handles writes, while replicas (slaves) replicate data from the master and handle read requests.

What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application?
Primary Node: Handles write operations. Application servers send write queries to the primary node, ensuring consistency in the database.
Replica Node: Handles read operations. Application servers can distribute read queries among replica nodes, improving scalability and responsiveness.

Single Points of Failure (SPOF):

Issue: The web server and load balancer on Server 1 constitute a SPOF. If Server 1 fails, the entire system can experience downtime.


Security Issues:

No firewall mentioned: Lack of proper firewall configuration can expose servers to unauthorized access and attacks.

Monitoring:

Issue: Lack of monitoring tools and practices can lead to undetected issues, performance bottlenecks, or security breaches.
